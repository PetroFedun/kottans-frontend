Hello my name Petro.
I am from Ternopil (Ukraine). I am beginner frontend developer.

## GIT Basics

The impressions of the material learned are very good.
I installed and run Git on a local machine.
Also, I created my first repository, clone origin repository, made commits.
I understood why version control is the main tool for coding and collaboration.
